                <p>Well... I've reached my final year of Highschool. And with that comes a lot of projects and extra
                    things. Like a final project, chrysostomos, school trip and of course an internship. We had to find
                    our own place before the end of october so we could follow a 2 week internship. I've chosen for:</p>

                    <article>
                        <p>It was a whole process making the board work, but after a lot of hours of work I finally
                            managed to do it. Here is my story.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I had to work with Docker to set up a virtual environment. I had to follow a step by step
                            guide provided by my internship leader. The next step was to clone a GitHub repository with
                            all the data to make projects with the test board. This took ages to clone so I took a
                            little
                            brake. When it was finally ready I had to build a project. But there was a secret surprise
                            hiding in my computer. <strong style="color: aqua;">My storage!</strong> Around 3/4 of the
                            loading it gave an error: my diskspace was full. It used literally everything it could use:
                            There was 15MB left. It gave me the option to completely whipe my progress
                            and start over again. After letting it load for another hour it finally finished. I tried it
                            out that night after my swimming practice. The test programs that came with the GitHub
                            repository worked on the board and a Led started blinking. But writing my own code was
                            difficult. C++ is a weird language and I couldnt just compile the program. It had to be run
                            in debug mode while the board was connected. Also C++ didn't reconize a lot of the
                            components and didn't give usefull suggestions like other programming languages. I called it
                            a day and took the board with me the next day to show it to my teacher and figure out how it
                            worked.

                    <article>
                        <p>I thought it was a nice little extra to make a website. I had made websites in the past but
                            mostly to play little games on. This was the first time I had to make an actual informatif
                            website.
                        </p>
                        <p>Making a website always starts with a homepage. I had a fun idea: write <strong
                                style="color: greenyellow;">"Hello World!"</strong> in
                            every language I know. I also added a fun little gimmick: when you click on the hello world
                            text it will be copied to your clipboard.</p>
                        <p>
                            I als made an about me page. It includes my age down to the second, my hobbies and info
                            about my dog (I may add more later).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The next page was a page where I share my projects. I'm really excited making this and
                            sharing my projects with the world. It will also includes links to HTML projects I've made
                            previously.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The last page was a blog page. For now I will only use it for my blog about my Philips
                            internship but I may add more blogs later. I will write a blog every day after my internship
                            at Philips about my experience.

                    <h3><i>06/11/2023</i></h3>
                    <article>
                        <p>Today was my first day at Philips. Let me tell you!
                        </p>
                        <p>Yes I'm doing an internship in Eindhoven while I live in 'boerengat' Maaseik. Luckly the boss
                            of the team where I'll do my internship gives me a lift to Eindhoven. I'm befriended with
                            his daughter and because of them I can do an internship at Philips. Big thanks to Amy and
                            Mike! Mike is awesome and it was a fun ride to Eindhoven. He also has a cool car! The
                            Philips was big! We took some tea and went to his office. He explained how the team works
                            and what they do.</p>
                        <p>
                            I was introduced to my internship leader Rob. He was the only one in the office. The rest of
                            the team worked from home. I met some of them shortly online. We started by making a Git
                            repository for my small little project. Ofcourse I can't work straight away with the
                            projects they do: they are way to complicated! We imported the opensource software they have
                            created for the test board. After some trail and error we finally managed to do it. We tried
                            the debug led and it worked! Then I learned how to print info to the boards terminal. I
                            couldn't just access it on my computer. I had to download a special program that
                            communicates with the board to read it's datalines. To make it simple:
                        <blockquote style="text-align: center;"><i>"I write data from my computer to a testboard with a
                                program to then read the data from the testboard to my computer with a program"</i>
                        </blockquote>
                        That is it basically...
                        </p>
                        <p>I tried figuring out how the timer function works. So to put it simple: when the
                            microcontroller starts, it will start counting the uptime in milliseconds. You could use
                            this to make a button that you have to hold for 1 second:
                        <blockquote>You save the time when the button is pressed and save the current time. By
                            subtracting these 2 you will get the time that the button is on hold (basic time
                            calculations)</blockquote>I couldn't finish it today so tomorrow is another day!</p>
                        <p>It was cool seeing how a team works in an office and how it exactly works. I will also be
                            working with a small robot that I'll be controlling with a mobile app!</p>
