                <p>Well... I've reached my final year of Highschool. And with that comes a lot of projects and extra
                    things. Like a final project, chrysostomos, school trip and of course an internship. We had to find
                    our own place before the end of october so we could follow a 2 week internship. I've chosen for:</p>

                <p>I have to say: this is an amazing place to do an internship. I was provided with a testboard that
                    they used to simulate the connection between the device and the surroundings</p>

                        <p>It was a whole process making the board work, but after a lot of hours of work I finally
                            managed to do it. Here is my story.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I had to work with Docker to set up a virtual environment. I had to follow a step by step
                            guide provided by my internship leader. The next step was to clone a GitHub repository with
                            all the data to make projects with the test board. This took ages to clone so I took a little
                            brake. When it was finally ready I had to build a project. But there was a secret surprise
                            hiding in my computer. <strong style="color: aqua;">My storage!</strong> Around 3/4 of the
                            loading it gave an error: my diskspace was full. It used literally everything it could use:
                            There was 15MB left. It gave me the option to completely whipe my progress
                            and start over again. After letting it load for another hour it finnaly finished. I tried it
                            out that night after my swimming practice. The test programs that came with the GitHub
                            repository worked on the board and a Led started blinking. But writing my own code was
                            difficult. C++ is a weird language and I couldnt just compile the program. It had to be run
                            in debug mode while the board was connected. Also C++ didn't reconize a lot of the
                            components and didn't give usefull suggestions like other programming languages. I called it
                            a day and took the board with me the next day to show it to my teacher and figure out how it
                            worked.
