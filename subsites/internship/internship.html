                <p>Well... I've reached my final year of Highschool. And with that comes a lot of projects and extra
                    things. Like a final project, chrysostomos, school trip and of course an internship. We had to find
                    our own place before the end of october so we could follow a 2 week internship. I've chosen for:</p>

                    <h3><i>23/10/2023</i></h3>
                    <article>
                        <p>It was a whole process making the board work, but after a lot of hours of work I finally
                            managed to do it. Here is my story.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I had to work with Docker to set up a virtual environment. I had to follow a step by step
                            guide provided by my internship leader. The next step was to clone a GitHub repository with
                            all the data to make projects with the test board. This took ages to clone so I took a
                            little
                            brake. When it was finally ready I had to build a project. But there was a secret surprise
                            hiding in my computer. <strong>My storage!</strong> Around 3/4 of the
                            loading it gave an error: my diskspace was full. It used literally everything it could use:
                            There was 15MB left. It gave me the option to completely whipe my progress
                            and start over again. After letting it load for another hour it finally finished. I tried it
                            out that night after my swimming practice. The test programs that came with the GitHub
                            repository worked on the board and a Led started blinking. But writing my own code was
                            difficult. C++ is a weird language and I couldnt just compile the program. It had to be run
                            in debug mode while the board was connected. Also C++ didn't reconize a lot of the
                            components and didn't give usefull suggestions like other programming languages. I called it
                            a day and took the board with me the next day to show it to my teacher and figure out how it
                            worked.

                    <article>
                        <p>I thought it was a nice little extra to make a website. I had made websites in the past but
                            mostly to play little games on. This was the first time I had to make an actual informatif
                            website.
                        </p>
                        <p>Making a website always starts with a homepage. I had a fun idea: write <strong
                                style="color: greenyellow;">"Hello World!"</strong> in
                            every programming language I know. I also added a fun little gimmick: when you click on the
                            hello world
                            text it will be copied to your clipboard.</p>
                        <p>
                            I also made an about me page. It includes my age down to the second, my hobbies and info
                            about my dog (I may add more later).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The next page is a page where I share my projects. I'm really excited making this and
                            sharing my projects with the world. It will also includes links to HTML projects I've made
                            previously.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The last page is a blog page. For now I will only use it for my blog about my Philips
                            internship but I may add more blogs later. I will write a blog every day after my internship
                            at Philips about my experience.

                    <h3><i>06/11/2023</i></h3>
                    <article>
                        <p>Today was my first day at Philips. Let me tell you!
                        </p>
                        <p>Yes I'm doing an internship in Eindhoven while I live in 'boerengat' Maaseik. luckily the boss
                            of the team where I'll do my internship gives me a ride to Eindhoven. I'm befriended with
                            his daughter and because of them I can do an internship at Philips. Big thanks to Amy and
                            Mike! Mike is awesome and it was a fun ride to Eindhoven. He also has a cool car! The
                            Philips was big! We took some tea and went to his office. He explained how the team works
                            and what they do.</p>
                        <p>
                            I was introduced to my internship leader Rob. He was the only one in the office. The rest of
                            the team worked from home. I met some of them shortly online. We started by making a Git
                            repository for my small little project. Of course I can't work straight away with the
                            projects they do: they are way too complicated! We imported the opensource software they
                            have
                            created for the test board. After some trail and error we finally managed to do it. We tried
                            the debug led and it worked! Then I learned how to print info to the boards terminal. I
                            couldn't just access it on my computer. I had to download a special program that
                            communicates with the board to read it's datalines. To make it simple:
                        <blockquote style="text-align: center;"><i>"I write data from my computer to a testboard with a
                                program to then read the data from the testboard to my computer with a program"</i>
                        </blockquote>
                        That is it basically...
                        </p>
                        <p>I tried figuring out how the timer function works. So to put it simple: when the
                            microcontroller starts, it will start counting the uptime in milliseconds. You could use
                            this to make a button that you have to hold for 1 second:
                        <blockquote>You save the time when the button is pressed and save the current time. By
                            subtracting these 2 you will get the time that the button is on hold (basic time
                            calculations)</blockquote>I couldn't finish it today so tomorrow is another day!</p>
                        <p>It was cool seeing how a team works in an office and how it exactly works. I will also be
                            working with a small robot that I'll be controlling with a mobile app!</p>

                    <article>
                        <p>Today, I was too late... But I can blame traffic. Traffic is the only downsight of my
                            internship, it is a 1 hour drive (if you're lucky).
                        </p>
                        <p>Today I finished my code that I was working on yesterday. Rob showed me an easier way of
                            doing it. I explained yesterday how I did it but I didn't know the package they use at
                            Philips has that feature built in. It is good that I first try my own implementation of the
                            problem before using easier tools made by other people.</p>
                        <p>Rob brought the robot with him and showed me how it worked shortly. He wrote a quick sloppy
                            code to check if the components worked. Now my task is to write a better, more readable and
                            safer code. We are thinking of controlling the robot with a mobile app. If I want to do that
                            I'll have to visit the mobile app department (they sit next to us). But before we can do
                            that we first have to finish the code</p>
                        <p>We also got a lesson about the difference between pointers and refferences in
                            <strong>C++</strong>. I've also learned the difference between i++ and ++i:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
                            by doing <strong>i++</strong> it will first return the value of <strong>i</strong> and then
                            it will add 1 to <strong>i</strong><br>
                            <strong>++i</strong> will first add 1 to <strong>i</strong> and then return the value of
                            <strong>i</strong> (with the 1 added)<br>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>So to sum it up:</p>
                        <blockquote style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
                            let's say we have a var "number" with the value 1<br>
                            <strong>number++</strong> --> return "number" and add 1 to "number"
                            after<br>
                            <strong>++number</strong> --> add 1 to "number" and return "number"
                            after
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                            I'll remember this the rest of my life!<br>
                            To end this day I had made a binary counter that uses the 3 built in leds on the test board.
                            It can count from 0 to 7 (8 bits --> 1 byte)!
                        </p>
                        <p>Tomorrow is a Wednesday but I still have to work from 8 to 5 so I'll miss my swimming
                            practice :(</p>

                    <h3><i>08/11/2023</i></h3>
                    <article>
                        <p>To be honest, the day passed like a speed train. But normally on Wednesday I have actual interesting classes.
                        </p>
                        <p>So... yesterday I was too late and today I was too early. But that doesn't matter because I can do more work. Today I started with the code from yesterday. We had to finalize the unit tests and finish the shiftregister. After that we had to make a PWM controller. The basic principle:</p>
                        <blockquote>With a PWM you can adjust the speed of a DC motor. Usually you can only turn it on and off. But by using a <strong>Pulse Width Modulation</strong> you can send pulses over the DC line. The wider the pulses the higher motor will turn. An image for more info:</blockquote>
                        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                            <img src="/pictures/pwmExample.png" alt="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Duty_Cycle_Examples.png" style="width: 100%;">
                        </div>
                        <p>Rob also showed me how they build software in 3 layers which is a unique experience for me. Then we worked on the PWM code. We couldn't test this code with the unit tests because this is directly based on the clock of the board itself. We finished it and put a general code in the <strong>Main.cpp</strong>. We hooked it up to the robot and... Nothing! After some checking we found out that we missed a part of the code that we had to copy (rookie mistake!). We fixed it and... Nothing! We hooked up an expensive testing kit to a test board to check the PWM output. Well... It did nothing.</p><p>After some digging we found out that there was a small problem in the code. Something we missed that was acutally really dumb. But not from us; from the manufacturers of the shiftregister.<br>To initialize the shiftregister we made a function to turn the shiftregister "on". We did this with -> <strong>enable.Set(true);</strong> because true = on = high = 1 = ...<br>You know what I mean. Well the manufacturers had the amazing idea to turn the shiftregister on by setting the enable pin to <strong>false!</strong>. I don't know which guy thought he was funny at the Texas Instruments office but I will find you!<br>So luckily the robot worked after this. Next up we had to write implementations and I had to write a MOCK for the implemented codes. I also managed to crash Visual Studio Code... Don't ask me how I did that!</p>
                        <p>That was it for today!</p>
